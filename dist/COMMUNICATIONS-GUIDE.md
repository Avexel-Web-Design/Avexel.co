## Key Differentiators

### What to Emphasize to Clients

#### 1. Cost Savings
"We offer professional-grade websites at a fraction of agency costs—typically 50-75% less—because we're students passionate about technology, not a corporate agency with high overhead."

#### 2. Modern Technology
"We use the same cutting-edge technology as Netflix, Airbnb, and Tesla. You're getting Fortune 500-level tech at small business prices."

#### 3. Direct Communication
"You'll work directly with the developer building your site, not a sales rep or project manager. This means faster decisions, better understanding, and a more personal experience."

#### 4. Supporting STEM Education
"Every project directly funds local high school robotics and STEM education. You're not just getting a website—you're investing in the next generation of tech leaders."

#### 5. No Lock-In
"You own your website completely. No monthly subscriptions, no platform fees, no being held hostage. You can take your site and host it anywhere, anytime."

#### 6. Performance & Speed
"Our sites load in milliseconds thanks to Cloudflare's global edge network. Faster sites mean better SEO, higher conversion rates, and happier users."

#### 7. Scalability
"Built on serverless architecture that automatically scales. Whether you have 10 visitors or 10,000, your site performs flawlessly without you doing anything."

#### 8. Local Connection
"We're Harbor Springs students serving Northern Michigan businesses. We understand the local market and community values."

#### 9. Multi-Platform Capability
"We don't just build websites—we create complete digital ecosystems. Your project can reach users on web browsers, iOS devices, Android phones, and desktop computers, all from a single codebase. This means consistent experience across all platforms at a fraction of what it would cost to develop separately."

#### 10. Native App Experience
"Our mobile apps aren't just websites in a wrapper—they're true native apps with push notifications, offline capability, and device integration. We can publish Android apps immediately to Google Play with our existing developer account. iOS apps can be built and tested, with App Store publication available once an Apple Developer account is set up."

**What to Share:**
- Our portfolio (frc7790.com, harborsoccerinc.com, avexel.co)
- Our story and mission
- General pricing structure
- Development timeline
- Our process

### Setting Expectations
**Timeline:**
- Simple sites (1-5 pages): 2-3 weeks
- Medium complexity (6-10 pages, some features): 3-5 weeks
- Complex sites (e-commerce, custom features): 6-12 weeks
- Mobile apps (iOS + Android): +1-2 weeks after website
- Desktop apps: +1-2 weeks after website

**Availability:**
- We're students, so we work around school schedules
- Flexible meeting times (evenings, weekends)
- Response time: typically within 24 hours

**Client Responsibilities:**
- Provide content (text, images, videos)
- Timely feedback on designs/mockups
- Domain/hosting account access
- Payment upon completion

### Common Concerns & How to Address Them

#### "You're just students—are you experienced enough?"
**Response:** "Our team has built websites for multiple businesses and organizations, handling everything from simple brochure sites to complex systems with user authentication, payment processing, and database management. We use the same professional tools and practices as major tech companies. Plus, you're getting our undivided attention—not handed off to junior developers like at big agencies."

#### "What if something breaks after launch?"
**Response:** "We provide a 30-day bug fix guarantee at no additional cost. After that, we offer ongoing maintenance at $50/hour, or we can help you find another developer—you own the code. Our sites are built with clean, well-documented code that any developer can work with."

#### "Why are your prices so much lower than other developers?"
**Response:** "We're students fundraising for our robotics team, not a traditional agency with high overhead costs. We don't have office rent, expensive sales teams, or corporate profit margins. Plus, we're genuinely passionate about this—it's not just a job for us."

#### "Can you handle [specific feature]?"
**Response:** "Let me check on that specific integration. We've successfully implemented user authentication, payment processing, booking systems, admin panels, and more. If it's something new to us, we're quick learners and have a network of mentors. We'll be honest if something is beyond our capabilities."

#### "What about SEO?"
**Response:** "Every site we build includes SEO optimization: proper meta tags, semantic HTML, fast load times, mobile responsiveness, and sitemap generation. For ongoing SEO strategy and content optimization, we can provide guidance or connect you with SEO specialists."

#### "Can I update the site myself?"
**Response:** "For blogs/news sections, we can build a no-code editor. For other content, updates are billed at $50/hour. We design this way to ensure your site remains fast and secure, without the bloat of traditional CMSs like WordPress."

#### "Do I really need a mobile app if I have a responsive website?"
**Response:** "It depends on your goals. A responsive website works great for most businesses. Consider a mobile app if you need: push notifications to re-engage users, offline functionality, native device features like camera/GPS, or want to build brand loyalty with a home screen presence. Many of our clients start with just a website and add an app later when they see demand."

#### "Will my app work on both iPhone and Android?"
**Response:** "Yes! We use Capacitor, which lets us write code once and deploy to both iOS and Android. Android apps can be published immediately to Google Play since we have an active developer account. For iOS apps, we can build and test the app, but publishing to the Apple App Store requires an Apple Developer account ($99/year). You can either set up your own account, or we can add this cost to the project if you'd like us to handle it. Many clients start with Android first and add iOS later."

#### "How do app updates work?"
**Response:** "For content updates that pull from your website, those happen automatically—no app update needed. For new features or changes to the app itself, we push updates through the app stores. Apple and Google handle the distribution to your users. We can help you manage this process, and updates to the app code are billed at our standard $50/hour rate."

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Unrealistic timeline expectations
- Unclear project scope ("I'll know it when I see it")
- Budget way below project scope
- Frequent comparison shopping mid-project
- Unwillingness to provide content/materials
- Expecting unlimited revisions

### When to Say No
We should politely decline if:
- Client expects free work or "exposure"
- Project involves illegal/unethical content
- Timeline is completely unrealistic
- Client is hostile or disrespectful
- Scope is beyond our current capabilities
- Budget doesn't match minimum project cost

## Common Client Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions

**Q: What's the difference between your sites and WordPress?**  
A: WordPress is a content management system (CMS) that requires constant updates and can become slow/vulnerable. We build custom React applications that are faster, more secure, and tailored exactly to your needs. The tradeoff is that content updates require developer assistance (or our no-code blog system).

**Q: Will my site work on mobile?**  
A: Yes! Every site we build is fully responsive and mobile-first. We test on multiple devices and screen sizes.

**Q: How fast will my site be?**  
A: Very fast. Our sites typically load in under 1 second thanks to Cloudflare's edge network, optimized code, and modern build tools.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Yes. We implement industry-standard security practices: SSL encryption, secure authentication, input validation, rate limiting, and regular security audits.

**Q: Can I get analytics?**  
A: Yes, we set up Google Analytics and Cloudflare Analytics on every site so you can track visitors, popular pages, and user behavior.

**Q: Can you integrate with [third-party service]?**  
A: Most likely! We've integrated with payment processors (Stripe), email services, calendars, social media, and more. If there's an API, we can usually work with it.

**Q: Do you build mobile apps?**  
A: Yes! We build native mobile apps for iOS and Android using Capacitor. Your app will be published on the App Store and Google Play Store, with full access to native device features like push notifications, camera, and offline storage. We use a single codebase that works across platforms, keeping costs down while maintaining native performance.

**Q: What's the difference between a website and a mobile app?**  
A: A website works in a browser, while a mobile app is downloaded from the App Store or Google Play and installed on your device. Apps can access native features (camera, notifications, etc.), work offline, and appear on your home screen. We can build both, and often the best approach is a responsive website with an optional companion app for users who want the native experience.

**Q: How long does it take to get an app approved?**  
A: After development is complete, Apple's App Store typically reviews apps within 1-3 days, while Google Play can take a few hours to a few days. We handle the submission process and help you meet all the requirements. Total time from development to live: typically 2-4 weeks for the app development plus 1-2 weeks for store approval.

**Q: Do I need to pay Apple or Google?**  
A: For Android apps, we have an active Google Play Developer account, so the $25 one-time registration fee is already covered. For iOS apps, the Apple Developer Program costs $99/year and is required to publish to the App Store. You can either set up your own Apple Developer account, or we can include this in the project cost and handle it for you. These fees go directly to Apple and Google, not to us, and we can guide you through the account setup process.

**Q: Can you build desktop apps too?**  
A: Yes! We can create desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux using Electron. These are native desktop apps that can access the file system, integrate with the OS, and work offline. Used by popular apps like VS Code, Slack, and Discord.

### Business Questions

**Q: Do I own the website?**  
A: Yes, completely. You own all the code, content, and can host it wherever you want.

**Q: What if you stop doing web development?**  
A: You have all the code and documentation. Any React developer can maintain it. We'll also help with handoff if needed.

**Q: Can you help with hosting?**  
A: Yes! We typically set up clients on Cloudflare Pages (free for most sites) but can work with any hosting provider.

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**  
A: We're open to discussing payment schedules for larger projects (50% upfront, 50% at launch, etc.).

**Q: What's your refund policy?**  
A: We work iteratively with client feedback throughout. If you're unhappy at any stage, we'll work to make it right. Full refunds before development starts; partial refunds based on work completed.

**Q: Can you help with ongoing marketing/SEO?**  
A: We can provide basic guidance, but specialized marketing/SEO is outside our core expertise. We can refer you to trusted partners.

### Project Questions

**Q: How long will my project take?**  
A: Depends on complexity:
- Simple (1-5 pages): 1-2 weeks
- Medium (6-10 pages + features): 2-3 weeks  
- Complex (e-commerce, custom systems): 2-6 weeks

**Q: What do you need from me?**  
A: Content (text, images, videos), brand assets (logo, colors), timely feedback on designs, and payment upon completion.

**Q: How many revisions do I get?**  
A: We work iteratively, so you'll see progress throughout. We include reasonable revisions in the initial price. Major scope changes may require price adjustment.

**Q: Can I see the site before it launches?**  
A: Absolutely! We provide staging environments where you can test everything before going live.

**Q: What if I want to add features later?**  
A: No problem! We can add features anytime at $50/hour or quote larger additions.

## Talking Points for Client Conversations

### Opening Pitch
"We're Avexel Web Design, a student-led team from Harbor Springs High School. We build professional websites and native mobile apps using the same technology as Netflix, Airbnb, and major companies, but at prices local businesses can afford. We create cross-platform solutions—your project can reach users on the web, iOS, Android, and desktop. Every project we complete funds our robotics team and STEM education programs. We'd love to help you build a strong digital presence while making a difference in our community."

### Value Proposition
"You'll get a custom-built, lightning-fast website—and optionally native iOS and Android apps—for 50-75% less than traditional agencies. We use Capacitor and React to write code once and deploy everywhere, which means you get multi-platform coverage without paying for separate development. You'll work directly with the developers building your site—no middlemen, no sales reps. And your project helps high school students pursue careers in technology."

### Closing Statement
"We're excited to work with you and create something you'll be proud of. Let's schedule a time to discuss your project in detail and provide you with a custom quote. We typically respond within 24 hours and can have an initial consultation within a week."
